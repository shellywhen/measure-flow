# DSP API for Node.js

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jussi-kalliokoski/node-dsp.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jussi-kalliokoski/node-dsp)

A node implementation of the [DSP API](http://people.opera.com/mage/dspapi/).

The DSP API offers natively backed (fast!) array operations for ```Float32Array```s, via the ```DSP``` ```FFT``` and ```Filter``` interfaces.

## Warning

Everything isn't quite working yet, especially the filter interface seems to be a bit buggy, but I'll do my best to get a complete & bug-free implementation, and then start working on optimizing the performance. Help is welcome!
